# ender3_addons
Addons for the Creality Ender3 3D Printer, including a [laser engraver](https://github.com/Vitorbnc/ender3_addons/tree/main/Laser%20Engraving%20Module) and a [PCB CNC mill (Fresa CNC para PCB)](https://github.com/Vitorbnc/ender3_addons/tree/main/Fresa%20CNC%20para%20Impressora%203D). The mill works very well for drilling PCBs. 

There's a [guide to building the CNC mill here](https://hackaday.io/project/174733-ender-3-pcb-drilling).
